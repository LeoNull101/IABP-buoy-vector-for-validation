# IABP buoy vector for validating the retrieved sea ice drift (SID) from remote sensing data
First, I want to thanks the IABP project for providing data.

The date of buoy data is from 2018 to 2022.
I used the buoys from IABP Arctic programme to generate the drift of sea ice, actually, IABP provide buoys which arer set by multi project such as MOASIC etc.
So, I cannot say the buoy is only from IABP.

2, 3, 6 in file name represent the time interval.
The 2 means uses the location of buoy in 00ï¼š00  to 00:00 in the two days after for generate drift.
The unit of speed is m/s.

Contact:528211870@qq.com for more information
Code will be upload in future.
That's all.
